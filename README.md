# MemoryGame
2 levels of game
I started 'programming' (huge word;) ) about 3 months ago and I felt in love. Of course, it's no more love of the first sight - there are more and more moments that I want to drop it
 facing the fact I won't be doing it for living. After a while I'm coming back and starting all over, so it must be love:) I know this particular course isn't for me because of lack
 of experience in C#. I hope not offending you by sending the solution in Python. I'd be grateful for your feedback despite the programming language. It was great challange for me and
 another step to realise how much I have to learn. As you could notice the next step for me is to learn how to use GitHub.
